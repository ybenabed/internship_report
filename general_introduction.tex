\chapter*{Introduction}

% As data continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly critical for
% organizations to be able to easily manage and sort their datasets, whether they
% come from databases, files or other sources. For this purpose, Talend already
% offers the \href{https://www.talend.com/products/data-inventory/}{Data Inventory} tool

% Nearest neighbor search is a topic that occupied a lot of interest in the
% machine learning search field as its exhaustive solutions require a lot of time
% and resources to find the solution. Due to the complexity in time of the
% exhaustive solutions when the number of points and their dimension get bigger
% (curse of dimensionality), the exact nearest neighbor problem is then
% reformulated into (\Acrfull{ann}).

% \acrfull{lsh} is one of the methods that tackles the problem of the approximate
% nearest neighbor search, it consists of using the hashing technique to map the
% near data points to the same buckets with high probability, and map the distant
% one to the same buckets with low probability.
