In the previous section we have shown the different metrics that can be used to
measure the distances or similarities between data points and that can be used
in our case, and we briefly introduced the \acrshort{lsh} methods that can be
used to estimate each one of the metrics. In this section we will present in
details the process of applying each one of them.
